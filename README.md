## Problem  
Diabetes is a chronic condition where blood sugar levels remain persistently high, requiring patients to monitor their diet and glucose levels closely. Currently, many diabetic patients use a glucose meter to measure their blood sugar levels, which involves frequent finger pricks. In some cases, patients need to test their blood sugar up to 7 times a day, which can be inconvenient and uncomfortable.

## Solution  

**Dia-sure** aims to simplify the management of diabetes by reducing the frequency of blood sugar testing. Hereâ€™s how our app works:  

1. **Diet and Blood Sugar Logging**  
   - The user logs their **diet details** and **blood sugar levels** **3 times a day** for **2 weeks**.
   - This process collects enough data for predictive analysis, offering insights into blood sugar patterns and changes.

2. **Blood Sugar Level Prediction**  
   - Based on the data analysis, the app predicts the **current blood sugar level** of the user, reducing the need for frequent blood tests.
   
3. **Personalized Suggestions**  
   - The app suggests foods that are suitable to eat at that moment and provides guidance on portion sizes based on individual needs.
   
4. **Personalization**  
   - Recognizing that each person has a unique metabolism rate and lifestyle, the app provides **personalized recommendations** tailored to the userâ€™s specific response to different food items and the time they consume them.
